Solve the following problem using Flask:

Create a Flask application that supports dynamic URL routing:

/user/<username> → Displays "Hello, <username>!"
/square/<int:num> → Displays "The square of <num> is <result>"
/post/<int:post_id> → Displays "Viewing Post <post_id>"
Ensure that numeric values are properly handled and displayed.
