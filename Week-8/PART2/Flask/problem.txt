Solve the following problem using Flask and WTForms:

Create a Flask application that includes a login form with fields for:
Username
Password
When the form is submitted:
Validate that both fields are filled.
If the username is "admin" and the password is "password", display "Login successful!"
Otherwise, display "Invalid credentials. Please try again."
Requirements:
Use Flask-WTF to create the form.
Use validate_on_submit() to check form submission.
Use Flaskâ€™s flash() function to show error messages.
